# Isreali_Settlement_Viewshed

To use, download the entire respository and place it into a file called Viewshed. After opening the project in R Studio, open functions/computeViewshed.R and run just the line "source('functions/ShinyViewshed.R')" at the bottom. This will launch the local server where the project occurs.
